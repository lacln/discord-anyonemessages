# discord-anyonemessages
A discord bot that allows for messages to be created, edited and modified by anyone in which the message exists using commands

## Commands
- Create Post (/createnote)
- Modify Post (/editnote NUMBER CONTENT)
- Append Post (/appendnote NUMBER CONTENT)
- Delete Line (/notedel NUMBER LINENUMBER)

(Note: deleting notes are not currently supported, and should be deleted manually by a server admin)
FUTURE: /notedelete NUMBER --> checks if you wrote the note and deletes if true


#### Note Syntax
All notes start with:
Note Title - #XXXX
